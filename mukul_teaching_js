There are two types of functions in JS
Synchronous
	returns value immediately
Asynchronous
	Doesn't
	Things which take time, should go in asynchronous functions
	Javascript is a single threaded language
	Only one command can be run at a time


	Hmm, mUkul, how would you go about doing this at the same time:
		Converting an image from color to b&w (this takes 2 mins)
		Showing a loading bar which shows progress

		Conventional(both synchronous)
		image = loadimage(display(image)) ~takes no time
		loadLoadingBar() ~ will start off at 0%


		function loadImage(function mukul){
			%process taking time
			mukul(image)
		}
